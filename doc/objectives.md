## <span id="anchor"></span>Introduction

This is a required exam for the Linux Professional Institute DevOps
Tools Engineer certification. It covers basic skills in using tools
commonly used to implement DevOps.

This page covers the currently released objective for the Linux
Professional Institute DevOps Tools Engineer certification.

## <span id="anchor"></span>Candidate Description

The certification holder is either a professional software developer or
a professional system administrator who is involved in the production of
IT solutions which require a robust and efficient process to get from
original source materials to a final deployed or distributable product
or service with a particular focus on using Open Source technology. The
certification holder has the ability to create, deliver and operate
software using collaborative methods which address aspects of software
development as well as system administration. In particular, the
certification holder is adept at bridging the gap between the
development and operations of a solution or product. The certification
holder understands how these tools facilitate development and
operational tasks in the delivery of stable, scalable and up to date
services to users and customers.

## <span id="anchor-1"></span>Version Information

These objectives are version 1.0.0.

## <span id="anchor-2"></span>Translations of Objectives

The following translations of the objectives are available on this wiki:

  - [Japanese](DevOps_Tools_Engineer_Objectives_V1\(JA\))

## <span id="anchor-3"></span>Exams and Requirements

The Linux Professional Institute DevOps Tools Engineer certification is
awarded after passing this exam. There is no requirement to posses
another certifications. LPI recommends all Linux Professional Institute
DevOps Tools Engineers to maintain at least one active certification in
either system administration or software development. This certification
should be on a level equivalent to LPIC-1.
